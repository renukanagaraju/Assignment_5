1. Obtain the elements of the union between two character vectors.
    vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
    vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
Ans:    union(vec1, vec2)

2. Get those elements that are common to both vectors.
    vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
    vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
Ans:   intersect(vec1, vec2)

3. Get the difference of the elements between two character vectors.
    vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
    vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[10:32,]))
Ans:  setdiff(vec1, vec2)

4. Test the quality of two character vectors.
    vec1 = c(rownames(mtcars[1:15,]))
    vec2 = c(rownames(mtcars[11:25,]))
Ans:  setequal(vec1, vec2)
